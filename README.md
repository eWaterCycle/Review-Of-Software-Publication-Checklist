# Review Of Software Publication, a Checklist

A checklist that reviewers can use when peer-reviewing academic papers that introduce new software. I'm sharing this checklist with three goals:

- It might help others when reviewing (or writing) papers about research software.
- Sharing this checklist also helps in expectation management: by referring to this checklist reviewers can clearly indicate what they did.
- By adopting this checklist as (part of their) reviewers guidelines journals communicate clearly to other scientists, but also to science-journalists and to society at large, what it means for a piece of software to be 'peer-reviewed'.

By sharing this checklist, in the spirit of Open Science, others are given the opportunity to build upon, comment and improve upon the list here provided. Please use pull requests on the [checklist](TheChecklist.md). When referencing this checklist (maybe because you used it when reviewing a paper), please cite it using this meta-data: [to do insert DOI from zenodo](to do insert DOI from zenodo)
